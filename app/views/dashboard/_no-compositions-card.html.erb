            The Pseudo EHR is configured to display Portable Medical Orders (PMOs) for the PACIO Advance Directive track at the January 2023 Connectathon. No PMOs were found for the selected patient.
            <br><br>
            Hint: Patients can appear similar but have different data. For an example patient with a PMO, click:
            <%= link_to 'Example-Smith-Johnson-Patient1', root_url + '/dashboard?patient=Example-Smith-Johnson-Patient1' %>
